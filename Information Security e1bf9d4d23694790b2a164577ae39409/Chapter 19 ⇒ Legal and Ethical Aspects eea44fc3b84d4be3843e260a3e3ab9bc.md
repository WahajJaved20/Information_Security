## Law Enforcement Challenges

Law enforcement agency difficulties:

- lack of knowledge and experience in investigators
- required tech might be beyond their budget
- global nature of cybercrime
- lack of collaboration and cooperation with remote law enforcement

| Cybercriminals | Cybercrime victims |
| --- | --- |
| lack of arrested criminals lead to increase in confidence | Are influenced by the success of cybercriminals and lack of success in law enforcement |
| are difficult to profile | Many organizations dont invest in resources to prevent cyber attacks |
| young and tech savvy | Reporting rates tend to be low due to lack in law enforcement |
| range of behavioral characteristics | Concern about corporate reputation and about civil liability |
| no cybercriminal database exists for pointing out a suspect |  |

 

## Working with Law Enforcement

Executive management & security administrators need to turn to law enforcement for help and view them as tools/resources.

Management needs to:

- understand criminal investigation process
- understand input needed by investigators
- how victims can contribute in investigation

# Privacy

Overlaps with computer security.

Dramatic increase in scale of information collected and stored!! (due to lack of law enforcement success, national security, and economic incentives)

Individuals have become increasingly aware of access and use of personal information and private details about their lives

Concerns about extent of privacy compromise have led to a variety of legal and technical approaches to reinforcing privacy rights

## EU Directive on Data Protection üá™üá∫

**Notice**: Notify individuals when their data is being collected.

**Consent**: individuals must have the choice of consenting to data collection and usage.

**Consistency**: terms must be created according to which personal data is used

**Access:** individuals must have the right to access their info and correct, modify or remove it

**Security**: data must be confidential and secure

**Onward transfer**: any third party accessing data must provide similar levels of security as the organizers form whom it was obtained.

**Enforcement**: each EU member must have a regulatory enforcement body concerned with privacy rights enforcement.

## United States Privacy Initiatives üá∫üá∏

- Deals with personal information collected and used by federal agencies
- Permits individuals to determine records kept
- Permits individuals to forbid records being used for other purposes
- Permits individuals to obtain access to records and to correct and amend records as appropriate
- Ensures agencies properly collect, maintain, and use personal information
- Creates a private right of action for individuals

## Privacy Protection

We need policy + technical approaches to protect privacy.

In terms of technical approach, we can use same database security measures for protection of data in information systems.

- With regard to social media sites, technical controls include:
    - The provision of suitable privacy settings to manage who can view data on individuals
    - Notification when one individual is referenced or tagged in another‚Äôs content
    - Although social media sites include some form of these controls, they are constantly changing, causing frustration for users who are trying to keep up with these mechanisms
- Another approach for managing privacy concerns in big data analysis is to anonymize the data, removing any personally identifying information before release to researchers or other organizations for analysis

## Data Privacy

Areas addressed by guidelines used to manage ‚Äúbig data‚Äù:

- **Consent**: Ensuring participants can make informed decisions about their participation in the research.
- **Privacy and confidentiality**: Privacy is the control that individuals have over who can access their personal information. Confidentiality is the principle that only authorized persons should have access to information.
- **Ownership and authorship:** Addresses who has responsibility for the data, and at what point does an individual give up their right to control their personal data.
- **Data Sharing:** The social benefits that result from data matching and reuse of data from one source or research project in another.
- **Governance and custodianship:** Oversight and implementation of the management, organization, access, and preservation of digital data

# Ethical Issues

‚ÄúA system of moral principles that relates to the benefits and harm of particular actions, and to the rightness and wrongness of motives and ends of those actions.‚Äù

Many potential misuses and abuse of information that create privacy and security problems stem from *unethical* basis.

## What are Ethics?

Behaviors of individuals in a society.

Rational justification of our moral judgements and actions; whats right and what isnt.

![Untitled](Chapter%2019%20%E2%87%92%20Legal%20and%20Ethical%20Aspects%20eea44fc3b84d4be3843e260a3e3ab9bc/Untitled%202.png)

## Ethical Issues related to Computer and Information Systems

- Repositories and processors of information.
- Producers of new forms and types of assets.
- Instruments of act.
- Symbols of intimidation and deception.

Those who understand, exploit the technology to their benefit, and those who have access permissions, have power over them.

## Professional/Ethical Responsibilities

Concerned with balancing professional responsibilities with ethical/moral responsibilities.

Ethical dilemmas in IT industry often faced:

- Loyalty to employer
- ‚ÄúBlowing the whistle‚Äù
- Exposing a situation which may harm the reputation or a customer
- Conflict of interest

Organizations have a duty to provide alternative, less extreme opportunities for the employee.

Professional societies should provide a mechanism whereby society members can get advice on how to proceed.

## Codes of Conduct

Ethics are not precise laws or set of facts.

Many areas may present ethical ambiguity which is why many professional bodies employ a code of conduct.

- Be a positive stimulus and instill confidence
- Be educational
- Provide a measure for support
- Be a means of deterrence and discipline
- Enhance the profession‚Äôs public image

## Comparison of Codes of Conduct

All three codes place their emphasis on the responsibility of professionals to other people

Do not fully reflect the unique ethical problems related to the development and use of computer and IT technology

Common themes:

- Dignity and worth of other people
- Personal integrity and honesty
- Responsibility for work
- Confidentiality of information
- Public safety, health, and welfare
- Participation in professional societies to improve standards of the profession
- The notion that public knowledge and access to technology is equivalent to social power
- All three codes place their emphasis on the responsibility of professionals to other people
- Do not fully reflect the unique ethical problems related to the development and use of computer and IT technology

## What is Social Power?

Capacity to assert control by creating desirable, legitimate values, without involving unconventional means.

Social power is majorly associated with politics. It originates from set rules and guidelines. With social power, one can influence, or even change, society.

Social power is used to exert control over others according to the interests and motivations of the person(s) in power. Generally, social power is characterized by tradition, charisma, and rational-legal authority.

## The Rules

Collaborative effort to develop a short list of guidelines on the ethics of computer systems

1. The people who design, develop, or deploy a computing artifact are **morally responsible for that artifact, and for the foreseeable effects of that artifact**. This responsibility is **shared with other people** who design, develop, deploy, or knowingly use the artifact as part of a sociotechnical system.
2. The shared responsibility of computing artifacts is **not a zero-sum game**. The **responsibility of an individual is not reduced simply because more people become involved** in designing, developing, deploying, or using the artifact. Instead, **a person‚Äôs responsibility includes being answerable for the behaviors** of the artifact and for the artifact‚Äôs effects after deployment, to the degree to which these effects are reasonably foreseeable by that person.
3. People who knowingly use a particular computing artifact **are morally responsible for that use**.
4. People who knowingly design, develop, deploy, or use a computing artifact can do so responsibly only when they **make a reasonable effort to take into account the sociotechnical systems** in which the artifact is embedded.
5. People who design, develop, deploy, promote, or evaluate a computing artifact should not **explicitly or implicitly deceive users about the artifact or its foreseeable effects,** or about the sociotechnical systems in which the artifact is embedded.

# Chapter 14 ⇒ IT Security Management and Risk Assessment

# What is Security Management?

It is the formal process of answering:

- What assets need protecting?
- How are those assets threatened?
- What can be done to counter those threats?

Ensure that critical assets are protected in a *cost effective manner*.

Security Risk Assessment **is needed for each asset** in the organization that requires protection!

# IT Security Management

A process used to achieve and maintain appropriate levels of CIAAA (confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, and authenticity)

Some IT Security Management functions include:

- Determining *organizational* IT security *objectives, strategies, and policies.*
- Determining organizational IT security *requirements*
- Identifying and analyzing risks
- Specifying appropriate safe guards
- Monitoring the implementation of these safeguards
- Developing and implementing *security awareness program*
- Detecting and reacting to incidents

# Organizational Context & Security Policy

Organizational security objectives define which IT security outcomes need to be achieved.

They need to be maintained and updated regularly using periodic reviews & reflecting on changes and technical risk assessments.

First, we need to examine the organization’s IT security:

| Objectives | wanted IT security outcomes |
| --- | --- |
| Strategies | how to meet those objectives |
| Policies | identify what needs to be done |

## Security Policy

Security policies need to address:

- Scope and purpose including relations of objectives to business, legal, and regulatory requirements.
- *IT security requirements*
- *Assignment of responsibilities*
- Risk management approach
- *Security awareness and training*
- General personnel issues and legal sanctions
- Integration of security into systems development
- *Information classification schemes*
- *Contingency plans*
- *Incident detection (and handling)*
- How and when to change policies

## Management Support

IT security policies need to be supported by upper/senior management

IT security officers need to:

- provide overall supervision
- liaison with senior management
- maintenance of security obj, strategies and policies
- handle incidents
- management of incident awareness and training programs
- interact with IT project security officers

Large organizations need separate IT officers associated with major projects and systems.

# Security Risk Assessment

Ideally examines each organizational asset.

There are 4 approaches:

1. Baseline
2. Informal
3. Detailed Risk
4. Combined

## 1. Baseline Approach

“Aims to implement most basic general level of security by using baseline documents, codes of practice and industry best practices.”

- Forms a good base for further security measures.
- Easy, cheap, and can be replicated.
- Only recommended for small organizations without the resources to implement a more structured approach.

## 2. Informal Approach

“Involves conduction some sort of informal, pragmatic risk analysis for organizations IT system.”

- There is no formal structured way of conducting, but rather, we exploit the existing knowledge and expertise of individuals performing the analysis.
- Fairly quick and cheap
- Some risks can be incorrectly assessed
- Skewed by analyst’s views, varies over time
- Suitable for small to medium sized organizations (where IT systems are not as essential)

## 3. Detailed Risk Analysis

“Most comprehensive approach to conduct organization’s IT system risk assessment using formal structured process.”

- May be legal requirement to use
- Assessed using formal structured process: num of stages, identify threats and vulnerabilities, and likelihood of risk occurring.
- Significant cost and time required
- Suitable for large organizations **where IT systems are critical to business objectives**.

## 4. Combined Approach

“Combines elements of baseline, informal, and detailed risk analysis approaches.”

- Aim is to provide reasonable levels of protection ASAP then examine and adjust protection controls over time.
- first, we start with implementation of baseline security recommendations on all systems.
- next, we expose them to high risk levels critical to the business objectives.
- then, we decide if we want to conduct an immediate informal risk assessments on key systems so we can tailor more specific controls to the business reqs.
- lastly, we can then perform a detailed security risk analysis.

Overtime, this can result in most appropriate and cost-effective security controls being selected and implemented.
